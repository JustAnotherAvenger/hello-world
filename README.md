Hello Alien Species that live amongst me. 

While the your idea of a non-earthly civilization (capable of inter-stellar trave, mind you) is completely founded in trust of the probability theorem. Your extrapolation of the behaviour exhibited by then onto the "indegineous species" (bipeds such as yourself) is purely based on your planet crust bound civilizations. Particularly the sequence of events based on when a "technologically advanced" race comes to an inferior species. Annihilation or subjugation seems to be key end goals to this behavior. There in lies the margin of acceptance of your acceptance towards the unknown.
